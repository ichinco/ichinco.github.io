  <h1 class="wallpaper nara-sci">Recommendations</h1>
  <div class="content">
     At <a href="http://www.naralogics.com">Nara Logics</a> I thought a lot
     about what makes really great recommendations and what it means to 
     "recommend" something to someone. I got a lot of experience debugging,
     diagnosing, and optimizing recommendations! I also got a lot of 
     experience writing white papers and figuring out how to explain
     how the technology works.

  <h1 class="wallpaper stm-eng">Search Engine Marketing</h1>
  <div class="content">
    I worked
    at <a href="http://www.smartertravelmedia.com/">SmarterTravel
    Media</a> where I analyzed the performance of their internet
    marketing portfolio and develop solutions to improve yields.

    When I'm investigating data, the place I like to start is by
    building the right visualization. Looking at the data is the first
    step toward being able to understand it. I like to build
    visualizations and prototypes in R, although occasionally I've
    built some data exploration tools in javascript with javascript
    graphing libraries when they were intended for wider use.

    Given the quantity of keywords we had, the amount of search data
    available was pretty massive. But still, one of the biggest
    challenges was accounting for things about which we had very
    little or no data at all, or where the data available had no
    predictive power.

  <h1 class="wallpaper cogsci">Cognitive Science</h1>
  <div class="content">
    I studied Cognitve Science
    at <a href="http://bcs.mit.edu/">MIT</a>. Cognitive
    science tries to understand how the brain processes the world
    around us and how one basic unit (the neuron) can combine to
    create the behavior we see in people. So a cognitive scientist
    might study vision, language, morality, the process by which
    any of these develop in children, or situations where they fail to
    develop. Unlike chemistry or physics, doing new work in cognitive
    science doesn't have to include an expensive machine or mastering
    laboratory techinques. As an undergrad, I was able to engage with
    problems at the "forest" level, not just the "trees," which
    involved a lot of thinking about how to read the results of
    someone else's work; about how to design an experiment to
    test a hypothesis; about how to interpret and visualize data; and
    about how to present those results persuasively.
  </div>
  <div class="content">
    Along the way I spent a lot of time
    in <a href="http://tedlab.mit.edu">TedLab</a>, where I analyzed
    the permissible orderings of sentences/ideas in a text
    (<a href="http://coli.lili.uni-bielefeld.de/Texttechnologie/Forschergruppe/PTTR/abstracts/Abstract-Kraemer.pdf">discourse
    analysis</a>). My project
    with <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~mcfrank/">Michael Frank</a>
    looked at cross-situational learning. I
    presented <a href="http://langcog.stanford.edu/papers/frank-cogsci08-generalization.pdf">the
    paper</a> at the Conference of the Cognitive Science Society in
    2009.
  </div>
  <div class="content">
    I also spent time in neuroscience labs.  In 2006, I worked in the
    lab
    of <a href="http://med.fsu.edu/index.cfm?fuseaction=directory.full&usemenu=&usetemplate=column&directoryID=15638">Nancy
    Hayes</a> at UMDNJ as a SURP student. My project looked at
    whether neurogenesis increased in mice who were trained on the
    morris water maze. In 2008, I worked with Liora Las in the lab
    of <a href="http://web.mit.edu/feelab/">Michale Fee</a>. We were
    studying activity in the ventral tegmental area of the songbird. I
    learned to do a little brain operation on the birds.

  <div class="content">
    Before 2008, I studied linguistics. I wrote a phonology paper on the
    distinction between the vowel sounds in the words "Merry",
    "Marry", and "Mary" which I presented at the Cornell Undergrad
    Linguistics Colloqium.
