    <h2>How I work.</h2>

    <p>
      I love using technology to create results for the business. I'm
      less about the "how" and more about the "what" and "why." I
      enjoy making tradeoffs between different ways of developing
      software.
    </p>

    <p>
      I build teams that disagree respectfully, take ownership, and
      continuously improve.

    <p>
      My team at <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/alexa">Amazon
      Alexa</a> owns two mission-critical pieces of software. One is a runtime
      service that is responsible for some of the most popular Alexa
      answers. The other is an internal facing tool. The service is
      known throughout Alexa for having low latency (p50 response time
      is 10ms), high availability (less than 6h of downtime in 2017),
      and for being scalable (each server handles 100tps).
    </p>

    <p>
      I manage 7 developers, from interns to Senior Software
      Engineers. I focus on driving operational excellence, developing
      strong agile processes, and meeting deadlines for delivery to
      our customers. I'm also experienced at managing high and low
      performers.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      At <a href="https://www.naralogics.com">Nara Logics</a>, I was
      responsible for one software developer and one intern. My team
      interfaced directly with prospective clients. I saw an
      opportunity to simplify the process of onboarding new categories
      of items to recommend by moving the configuration for the
      categories to the database. I spearheaded a project to create a
      RESTful interface that enabled one of my collegues to build an
      interface for onboarding clients.

    <h2 id="engineer">Experienced engineer.</h2>

    <p>
      I have 8 years of experience as a software engineer. The
      majority of that is in building server-side software in Java and
      Python. I write solid, testable code that scales well both on
      the server and in the database.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      At <a href="http://www.naralogics.com">Nara Logics</a>, I
      initially joined the data platform team. The data platform team
      owned a pipeline that synthesize data ingested from various
      sources (like lists of hotels or restuarants) so that it was
      available for recommendations. This was quite challenging and
      often involved making tradeoffs about how much configurability
      to add. I worked on projects to improve our ability to recognize
      that two strings refer to the same "entity", to build manual
      overrides, and to increase international support.  My focus as I
      coded was to improve test coverage and ensure the code would
      generalize across domains.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      At <a href="http://www.smartertravelmedia.com">SmarterTravel
	Media</a> I worked on the Search Engine Marketing Team. I
	built the software that aggregates the data into reports and
	communicates with the partners (ie, Google or MSN) to make
	bidding strategy changes. My focus was improving the
	performance of automated jobs, increasing the useability of
	the tools, and improving access to data via self-service
	reporting. I reduced the memory usage of the main bidding job
	by loading data incrementally and diagnosing memory leaks. I
	reduced the runtime of the sync job from weeks to hours by
	reducing the number of database calls.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The team at Quickhit was building the first NFL licensed online
      football game. I developed a 3D client in Unity3D to replace
      their existing flash client on an aggressive schedule. I replicated the structure for
      connecting to the server and developed the infrastructure for
      displaying the UI and controlling the game state. I gave a talk
      at Unite 2010 about some of the problems (and solutions) we
      encountered integrating the game into the web, including many of
      the networking issues we encountered.

    <h2 id="scientist">Analytical roots.</h2>

    <p>
      I developed a solid understanding of statistics and experimental
      design by studying cognitive science at MIT. I understand how to
      answer questions with data and can avoid common pitfalls. At
      work, I have used these skills to design benchmarking studies
      that were accepted by academic conferences and improve the yield
      of bidding algorithms for online advertising.
    </p>
    
    <p class="content">
      When I'm investigating data, I usually start by building with a
      visualization and looking at a sample of the raw data. This
      ensures that we don't miss important trends the might hide in
      summary statistics like the average.  
    </p>
    
    <p>
      At <a href="http://www.naralogics.com">Nara Logics</a> I
      debugged, diagnosed, and optimized recommendations for our
      clients. I designed baselines to determine the effectiveness of
      our algorithm. I co-wrote a white paper that was presented at
      RecSys 2016 during the industry session by the CTO.

    <p>
      During my time
	at <a href="http://www.smartertravelmedia.com">SmarterTravel
	Media</a> I worked on the Search Engine Marketing team. One of
	the key challenges was to optimize the price they paid for
	online advertising. Most of the bidding was done using rules
	systems, so I investigated whether we could improve our yield
	using machine learning techniques. (Note: I am not a machine
	learning engineer.) I found that introducing controlled
	randomness (via multi-armed bandits) improved yields over 43%
	on high volume keywords.

      As an undergrad, I studied Cognitve Science
      at <a href="http://bcs.mit.edu/">MIT</a>. Cognitive scientists
      study the way that the brain processes the world around
      us and how one basic unit (the neuron) can combine to create
      the behavior we see in people. So a cognitive scientist might
      study vision, language, morality, the process by which any of
      these develop in children, or situations where they fail to
      develop. Unlike chemistry or physics, doing new work in
      cognitive science doesn't have to include an expensive machine
      or mastering laboratory techinques. As an undergrad, I was
      able to engage with problems at the "forest" level, not just
      the "trees," which involved a lot of thinking about how to
      read the results of someone else's work; about how to design
      an experiment to test a hypothesis; about how to interpret and
      visualize data; and about how to present those results
      persuasively.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I spent a lot of time
      in <a href="http://tedlab.mit.edu">TedLab</a>, where I analyzed
      the permissible orderings of sentences/ideas in a text
      (<a href="http://coli.lili.uni-bielefeld.de/Texttechnologie/Forschergruppe/PTTR/abstracts/Abstract-Kraemer.pdf">discourse
      analysis</a>). My project
      with <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~mcfrank/">Michael
      Frank</a> looked at cross-situational learning. I
      presented <a href="http://langcog.stanford.edu/papers/frank-cogsci08-generalization.pdf">the
      paper</a> at the Conference of the Cognitive Science Society in
      2009. I've also worked in neuroscience labs
      with <a href="http://med.fsu.edu/index.cfm?fuseaction=directory.full&usemenu=&usetemplate=column&directoryID=15638">Nancy
      Hayes</a> and <a href="http://web.mit.edu/feelab/">Michale
      Fee</a>.

      Most recently, I sat on a lunch panel

      2018. Teodora Stoian, Evelyn Liang, and I discussed Scaling

    <p class="content">
      I took all of the "pirate" classes at MIT: sailing, fencing, and
      pistol. I also learned to ice skate, tried out archery, and
      practiced judo. Sailing was my favorite, although I haven't had
      the chance to do it since. Pistol was my least favorite, so of course
      everyone always suggests it as a fun outing.
    </p>

    <p class="content">
      I speak English natively, Spanish comfortably, and Chinese
      uncomfortably. Besides those three, I love learning languages and
      have convinced my native speaker friends to teach me a smattering
      of relatively impractical phrases.
    </p>

    <p class="content">
      I like being outside. I like being on the tops of mountains and
      the middle of rivers. It's a completely different kind of
      decision making.
