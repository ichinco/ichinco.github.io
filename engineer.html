  <p>I was quite involved in several projects including data pipeline,
  and analytics.</p>
  <p>When I first arrived, I immediately jumped into the data platform
  that helped structure and synthesize data ingested from various sources
  so that it was available for recommendation. This was quite challenging
  and often involved making tradeoffs and deciding how much configurability 
  to add. I worked on projects to improve how well we match entities to
  each other, to build manual overrides, and to increase international support.
  My focus as I coded was to improve test coverage and ensure the
  code would generalize as well as possible to other domains. 
  </p>
  <p>
  From there, I saw an opportunity to simplify the process of onboarding
  new categories of items to recommend. I spearheaded a project to move
  the configuration for the categories to the database, where I was able to
  expose it via a RESTful interface. One of my colleagues built a web frontend
  for it which demonstrated how valuable it was to be able to see the
  configuration values. Several iterations later, an internal web portal
  now helps people across the company improve client experience.
  </p>
  <p>
  As we began to take on clients, I played a large role in ensuring that
  the clients were satisfied and that the recommendations were working well
  for them. I developed dashboards and analyses that would help us 
  diagnose performance issues and understand what recommendations were
  being produced.

    In addition to my <a href="scientist.html">analytics</a> role, I
    also built the software that aggregates the data into reports and
    communicates with the partners (ie, Google or MSN) to make bidding
    strategy changes. My focus was improving the performance
    of automated jobs, increasing the useability of the tools, and
    improving access to data via self-service reporting.

    <p>The performance of the tools, in terms of both time spent and
    memory useage, is an everpresent focus when hundreds of thousands
    of keywords are added each day to a system that already makes tens
    of millions of bids. I've identified several areas where
    performance improvements needed to be made, including:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>reducing the memory useage of the bidding job by working
      around the need to load data upfront and ensuring that the data
      could be garbage collected when it was no longer needed</li>
      <li>rewrote job to sync ensure consistancy between our data and
      our partners to reduce the number of database calls; after
      rewrite, the job took less than an hour (where it had taken
      weeks)</li>
      <li>refactored main daily import job to be more reliable</li>
      <li>parallelized numerous api jobs</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Whenever I work on an internal tool, my priority is always to get
    feedback from the end users. I like to ask questions about how
    people plan to use the thing I'm building, build something rough,
    and use that to continue the discussion of what the final product
    should look like. At SmarterTravel, I built several new tools and
    refactored dozens of old ones to incorporate ideas for new
    functionality or eliminate pain points for our internal users.</p>

    <p>I fundamentally believe that fast access to data is the key to
    success of any part of any business. Engineers are busy and often
    "priorities" lie elsewhere, so the best data is data that can be
    accessed without help. At SmarterTravel, I was able to build a
    SqlServer Analysis Services Cube which was able to replace most of
    our canned reports as well as enable much more data exploration. I
    also helped analysts proactively expand their knowledge of SQL
    which enabled them to dig even deeper into the data.</p>

    My main accomplishment was to develop a 3D client for their
    flagship online football game on an aggressive schedule. I
    replicated the structure for connecting to the server and
    developed the infrastructure for displaying the UI and controlling
    the game state. I gave a talk at Unite 2010 about some of the
    problems (and solutions) we encountered integrating the game into
    the web, including many of the networking issues we encountered.
    </p>

    <p>
      Behind the scenes, there was quite a bit of work to be done to
      develop and automate the internal pipelines that produced the
      graphical assets for the game. Some parts of the pipeline
      integrated directly with 3DSMax, others automatically produced
      enums for inclusion in the code base.

  When I was at MIT, it felt like everyone could code. So although
  my plan was to major in linguistics (later switching to cognitive science),
  I always saw the value in learning to program a computer. In fact,
  I ended up enjoying MIT's intro to computer science-- a class that emphasized
  concepts like recursion using Scheme-- so much that I went on to take
  more classes. By the time I graduated, I had a solid background in 
  computer science fundamentals.
